# Terraform Infrastructure Repository

## Overview

This repository contains Terraform code for managing infrastructure in a modular way, allowing separation between frontend and backend configurations. The frontend setup is used for publishing a static website, while the backend is under development and aimed at providing flexible, customizable infrastructure deployments.

## Frontend

The frontend code in this repository is designed to publish a static website. It offers several benefits, including the ability to maintain a separate developer repository that triggers a CI/CD pipeline to pull this code and apply necessary variables stored in the developer's repository.

### Features

- **Modular Design:** Easily integrate with existing CI/CD pipelines.
- **Static Website Deployment:** Designed to efficiently host and manage static content.
- **Customizable Variables:** Allows developers to store and use their own variables for flexible deployments.

### Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/terraform-infrastructure.git
   cd terraform-infrastructure/frontend
   ```

2. **Initialize Terraform:**

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

3. **Apply the Configuration:**

   Before applying, ensure that your variables are correctly set up in your developer repository or in a separate `terraform.tfvars` file.

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

   **Note:** Ensure your AWS credentials are correctly configured to deploy the resources.

4. **CI/CD Integration:**

   - Use a CI/CD pipeline to automatically pull this code and apply it with the necessary variables for your environment.

## Backend

The backend code is currently a work in progress and aims to offer a flexible infrastructure solution.

### Current State

- **Not Fully Functional:** The backend code is still being developed and does not yet provide the complete functionality as intended by the author.
- **Local Repository Usage:** Designed to be pulled locally during pipeline execution, allowing for custom requirements and modifications to be applied.

### Future Goals

- **Complete Backend Functionality:** Enhance the code to support a wide range of infrastructure requirements.
- **WAF Protection:** Provide optional Web Application Firewall (WAF) protection by specifying it in the variables.

## Security

- **WAF Integration:** The infrastructure can be protected with a Web Application Firewall (WAF) if specified in the variables. This allows for enhanced security and protection against common web threats.

- **Sensitive Information:** Ensure that sensitive information, such as API keys and secrets, is stored securely and not hardcoded into the Terraform code. Use environment variables or secret management services.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes. Ensure your code adheres to the project's coding standards and includes appropriate tests.

### Additional Tips:

- **Customizable Variables:** 
  - Developers can specify variables to tailor the infrastructure to their specific needs. Example variables might include domain names, S3 bucket settings, or instance types.
  
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** 
  - Consider integrating with GitHub Actions or another CI/CD tool to automate deployment and ensure consistent infrastructure updates.

- **Future Enhancements:**
  - Plan to extend the backend to support different cloud providers or more complex setups, such as Kubernetes clusters or multi-region deployments.
